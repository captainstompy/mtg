make UI for sets
- a page that shows you available sets and which ones you have
- you can filter the sets
DONE - and if you want to add one, click ADD SET, and it will import it

Aftermath cards
- currently they're in separately
- need to make them a) "associate", b) display as one or linked in some way

Cards that appear in more than one set
- have a mode of "combine same cards" or whatever (ones with the same name)

Card UI
DONE - add ability to do initial search by set. or by owned. not just by type
- add quick-update of card #
- add filtering by rarity
- sort mana properly (so far, have determined it's probably a matter of attaching a custom "sortEngine" to the mana column; see lines 230 and 310 of bootstrap-sortable.js)

Card add
- right now it's saying it has successfully updated by the presence of a $_POST; make it throw an error if it fails and note that
