make UI for sets
- a page that shows you available sets and which ones you have
- you can filter the sets
- and if you want to add one, click ADD SET, and it will import it

Aftermath cards
- currently they're in separately
- need to make them a) "associate", b) display as one or linked in some way

Cards that appear in more than one set
- have a mode of "combine same cards" or whatever (ones with the same name)

Card UI
- add ability to do initial search by set. or by owned. not just by type
- add quick-update of card #
